The purpose of each server is to act as en echo server. When ever the server
receives an echo request from a client then it sends back an echo response
to acknowledge the request.

The purpose of this is to stress test each server design to determine their
efficiency and max performance in order to compare results.

Please read the Design Doc for further details.
